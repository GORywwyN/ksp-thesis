## Abstract

The *ksp-thesis* class is a LaTeX class intended for authors who want to publish 
their thesis or other scientific work with KIT Scientific Publishing (KSP). The 
class is based on the *scrbook* class of the *KOMA-script* package in 
combination with the *ClassicThesis* and *ArsClassica* packages. It modifies 
some of the layout and style definitions of these packages in order to provide 
a document layout that should be compatible with the requirements by KSP.
