The \textpkgname{ksp-thesis} class is a \LaTeX\ class intended for authors who want to publish their thesis or other scientific work with \emph{\KIT Scientific Publishing (\KSP)}. The class is based on the \textpkgname{scrbook} class of the \textpkgname{KOMA-script} package in combination with the \textpkgname{ClassicThesis} and \textpkgname{ArsClassica} packages. It modifies some of the layout and style definitions of these packages in order to provide a document layout that should be compatible with the requirements by \KSP.
